Next implements:

* Bring back types
* Moves
* States (Paralysed, poisoned, burned, frozen, KO, badly poisoned)
* Evolution line
* base EXP
* EXP management (curves, ...)
* publish tests

This will mark the end of Gen I implmentation. After that, I will add support of Gen II improvements, then Gen III, ...

__ Please note that some parts of the Gen II and higher are already implemented (mainly IV and EV) because it was pointless to implement DV knowing they are deprecated. __
