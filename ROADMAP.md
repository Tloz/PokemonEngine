Next implements:

* Bring back types
* Moves
* States (Paralysed, poisoned, burned, frozen, KO, badly poisoned)
* Evolution line
* base EXP
* EXP management (curves, ...)
* publish tests

This will mark the end of Gen I implmentation. After that, I will add support of Gen II improvements, then Gen III, ...

**Please note that some parts of the Gen II and higher are already implemented (mainly IV and EV) because it was pointless to implement DV knowing they are deprecated.**

**Please also note that some mechanics will be implemented with higher gen functionalities than the current ont. For example, reproduction will be added in gen II, but IV repartition will function as of current gen. On the other hand, this won't include anything related to the Nature until v3**
